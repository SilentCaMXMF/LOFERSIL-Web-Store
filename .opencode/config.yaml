    ðŸ¦• Welcome to the LOFERSIL Deno workspace!
    You are working in a Deno 2.x environment with Fresh + Preact.
    Follow Deno-only rules, use URL imports, and never invoke Node.js utilities.
    Key commands: 'deno task dev' to start dev server, 'deno test --allow-net --allow-env --allow-read --allow-import --unstable --unstable-kv' for tests, 'deno lint' for linting, 'deno fmt' for formatting, 'deno check --unstable src/**/*.ts' for type checking.
    Ensure all code adheres to Deno best practices, Fresh framework conventions, and AGENTS.md guidelines (e.g., 2-space indent, single quotes, no comments unless requested).
    Use Figma MCP to work on styles and layouts.
